🧬 README Synth GPT

✍️ Summary

A purpose-built GPT that transforms user-authored documentation into polished, structured Markdown READMEs with consistent tone and high-impact narrative.

🧩 Problem Statement

Crafting effective technical documentation is time-consuming, often inconsistent, and rarely captures the creator’s true intent. Whether for projects, portfolios, internal use, or public transparency, creators lack a reliable system to express their work in a structured and authentic way.

🛠️ Solution Overview

README Synth GPT solves this by ingesting an instruction set and prompting for key context questions. It then synthesizes the responses into a schema-compliant README, blending human-authored insight with LLM structure. The result: reliable, reproducible Markdown documentation that communicates what matters.
